# How to use:
If you're stuck with a partical problem, like developing a responsive-navigation of a special kind, it's a good idea to take a step back and solve the layout-problem abstractly first.

This repository is a good place to do so. Develop a pattern, check if it is working cross-browser and apply fixes, commit to this repo and only then start to apply your project specfic styles.

Others will be thankful, including your futre self ;)
